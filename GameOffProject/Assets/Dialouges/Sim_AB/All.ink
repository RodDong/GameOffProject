// 加班到很晚，去酒吧逛逛时碰到色欲

// 酒吧外景细节：
// 在拥挤的街道里，酒吧占据的面积更大。门口闪着灯红酒绿的光。酒吧二楼会是色欲的家。酒吧有两层。门口挂着Indulgence的名字，字体可以是连笔那种的暧昧的感觉。有2-3扇窗口，可以从外面看到里面的热闹人群。

// 酒吧内景：
// 灯光色调可以改成粉色，一种酒池肉林的感觉。酒吧中间灯光会稍微亮点，周围可以是稍微昏暗的光。沙发上有喝到吐的人

// 一开始，在酒吧门口：
// MC: (murmuring) “maybe I should get a drink for such a weary and repeating night…”
// MC：”Indulgence?”
// // MC:  “What a weird but straightforward name for a bar…”

// 换场景：进入到酒吧里面
// MC: ( lousy voices from people’s mouths and inside ) 
// MC: (swing body, different light shadows, and smelling of vomiting )
// MC: (unbearable for my ears… this place…. Not like me…) 
// MC: (why they seem to have a good time? This place looks not attractable at all
// MC: “Maybe… I should leave…” (quietly talking)

// 切换到色欲视角：从主角进来后，一直站在最角落注意着他
// S:  (staring at the door and eyes follow while MC walks in)（what a tasteful creature… a lost deer in the feast）
// S: (licks lips) “wait for me to approach, wait for me to have it, wait for me to enjoy it….”
// S: “A new PRAY, needs, a predator”

// // 场景：色欲拿着鸡尾酒来到主角面前
// is she coming to me? Or, is HE?

// their presence made this bar a little bit brighter.

// (left hand holds the wine and swings it slightly) “Don’t you wanna try something NEW? ”  #speaker:S #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

// Only God can make them. And their voice is gifted by Sirens. Luring my eyes and sensation. 

// their present made this night so much brighter to me…

// “oh…no… I mean…I don’t belong here.” #speaker:P #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

// “no one belongs to nowhere…” #speaker:S #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

// “…I only wish I can see more” #speaker:S #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

// “but… oh…” #speaker:P #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

// their body leans too close to mine…I should step back…

// no…my legs do not want to listen to me

// “I probably should… I should…” #speaker:P #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

// His glamuring eyes like black holes… 

// “Well, you should join me.” #speaker:S #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

// “just follow me” #speaker:S #portrait:neutural #tachie:none
 
// “I will lead you…” #speaker:S #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

// // 场景：色欲拉着主角来到沙发上
// now, their hands are on mine. Every touch burns me from inside…

// their heavy breath seems just near my ears

// staring at MC with slight smile #speaker:S #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

// “Will you.” (he gently leads my hands to cover his chest) #speaker:S #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

// their skin feels cold. But when they get close to me, my burning gets cooler.

// wanna feels it again…I cannot help it

// “You…want, here, here, or there…” #speaker:S #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

// “eyes…lips…I am in Eden…” #speaker:S #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

// this feels wrong. I should stop.

// “good boy. Keep doing.” #speaker:S #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

// \*heavy panting\*

// I am losing control. Is this the lust that I have?

// See, his hesitated eyes. His healthy body. So delicious… #speaker:S #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

// what is this lust for? Why does this desire emerge so strongly?

// S reaches out arm to hold MC’s back

// “...Making you inside of me or me inside of you.” #speaker:S #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

// \*heaving panting\*

// // 黑幕一下，表示doi结束

// “wanna know more about me?” #speaker:S #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

// the romantic smell from him makes me dizzy…I am tired inside of my soul…

// but so dangerous that I want to know more about them…

// “please… show me more…” #speaker:P #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

// “Come. Come to my world.” #speaker:S #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

// “now…pray bites the bait” #speaker:S #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

// 场景：主角跟着色欲离开酒吧，来到色欲的房间。

a menu from Feast…? What is this?

It is a luxurious place for enjoyment...

(Murmuring) “That is a weird name, just like that bar…” #speaker:P #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

sounds like coming from the same person.

the process should get going before my pray notices too much…

“how about taking a warm bath before we dig deep?” #speaker:S #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

“That sounds like a good suggestion.” #speaker:P #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

“Could you show me where the bath is?” #speaker:P #portrait:neutural #tachie:none
 
“all the way down the hallway and it will be on your left.” #speaker:S #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

(what is this smell？it does not smell good…it mixes with rust smelling) #speaker:P #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

MC离开后，场景还是在S的房间里：
S: “while my pray prepares himself, my plan needs to get going…”
S: “a little hallucinogens..should… make my plan well…”

切换到MC在浴室里：
MC: “I think I wake up a little…”
MC: “What have I done…”
MC: “I should not get myself into trouble…”
MC: “but I cannot stop myself when I see them…”
MC: “should I take a bath?”
MC: “I am too tired to move my body.”
MC: “...I will just pretend I finished the bath.”

场景切换到S房间：MC提前从浴室出来
S: (What?! Shit! He is fast! Didn’t he use the bath?) 
MC: “What are you doing? ”
S: (cannot let him know, lie, I need to lie to him…)
MC: “Are those hallucinogens? Wtf… who are you?”
S: “Now you see the truth.. You can never leave the room alive.”
