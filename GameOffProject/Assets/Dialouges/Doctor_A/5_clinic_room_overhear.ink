The doctor is going to prepare for the surgery. So he says. He seems to be in such a hurry.

\--That means, as always.

Having been seeing him for so long, I have this impression that the Doctor is always eager to make a quick diagnosis for everything.

Method-wise, he seems to prefer strong drugs than delicate therapies, and surgeries more than that. Simply utting off everything that go wrong.

Is that questionable? Well, maybe.

But he can make that kind of decisions as a fully-liscenced doctor, though.

As far as I know, few people would complain much after seeing him. If Doctor Maston really is able to solve their problems, maybe what he does really have a point.

Not something I should care about as long as he can quickly solve mine.

...Being discovered? What does that mean?

There are sounds of a hospital bed rolling down the hallway.

As it rises, the air begins to smell... shifty, greasy, and streangely... sweet...

Is that... blood?

Perhaps I need to have a look.
