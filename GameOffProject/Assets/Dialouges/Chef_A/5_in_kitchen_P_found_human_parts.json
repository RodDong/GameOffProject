It’s the fucking kitchen.","\n","^Or a side kitchen, a freezer work station? You don’t know how things work in restaurants’ kitchens.","\n","^No one’s here, perhaps the one…chef? Assistant? Whoever the person was, just left.","\n","^You took a quick minute to decide between whether you should exit the building and be stuck in that endless night trying to find a probably non-existent entrance, or to figure your way out from this kitchen to the main…sitting area. You suppose.","\n","^Not a hard decision to make.","\n","^You tried your best to not touch a thing and go straight to the closed door, and you gave up on the attempt in just a few seconds.","\n","^You saw something.","\n","^You saw SOMETHING.","\n","^*A HUMAN HAND*","\n","^Your brain went blank for a few seconds.

And not to your surprise you can see more…frozen meat left to be prepped. Frozen human body parts.","\n","^Were they…was that delicate lady, the owner of this place, serving human body parts?","\n","^*LEAVE*","\n","^You tried to run. You don’t know where this place is but it’s obviously doing something that’s beyond your comprehension and obviously law. It’s not too late for you to leave before you are caught staring at the biggest evidence itself.","\n","^*RUN*","\n","^You fumbled, trying to make way to that dark corridor that leads you here.
