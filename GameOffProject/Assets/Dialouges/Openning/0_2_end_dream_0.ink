The light faded. Or rather it is you who are fading. You, emerging from nothingness, and will soon be vanished back into nothingness. Your familiar nothingness, where nothing is sharp. 
Nothing hurts or scratches or leaves any trail of blood.
Because nothing really has any power No. All is safe and powerless and harmless and innocuous in the nothingness.
