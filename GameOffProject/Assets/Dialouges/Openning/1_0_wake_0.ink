"What was it... again? "#speaker:P #portrait:neutural #tachie:none

A sigh.

For these months I have been struggling with someone every two nights or so.

In the dream, of course. In a bizzare way.

We fight by trying to... blast our lust to each other, in some ways. That's pretty much all  I can remember. 

Another thing: my opponent must have always been the same person.

Seems like someone in my dream has endless desire on everything and somehow manages to beat me to the ground every time. 

There are countless mornings when I wake up, remember being flattened and feel like I have never slept at all.


Stranger still -- that someone who beats me every time -- it feels like he was me.

Not because the way he looks or talks -- you can't remember these from a dream. It was... a feeling. Just a feeling that I could not explain. Which makes the whole thing even more disturbing.

Why would I fight myself in every dreams?

Tuesday, or any of the days.
